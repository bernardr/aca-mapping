===========

An attempt to map Affordable Care Act locations in Utah. 

Initially, data came from [AvenueH.com](http://avenueH.com) website. That data has since been taken down. 

The data was then cleaned and geocoded using [geocoder.us](http://geocoder.us). 

Maps were made with: 

- Google Maps [https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zmO5F1X0vfy4.k2j1a8JeIgDc](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zmO5F1X0vfy4.k2j1a8JeIgDc) 
- [OpenStreetMap and MapBox](https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/bernardr.g805ncc9/page.html#11/40.7356/-111.8909)
